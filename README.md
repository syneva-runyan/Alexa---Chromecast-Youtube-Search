Alexa - Chromecast Youtube Search
==================

POC for exploring alexa-chromecast integration

Idea is for
1) Alexa to take in a youtube search term
2) Chromecast to display suggested results
3) Alexa to take in user's selection
4) Chromcast to play selected video

The chromecast section in this repo right now is copied directly from Google's chromecast example.
